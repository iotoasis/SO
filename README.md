# Oasis Project

Oasis (Open-source Architecture Semantic IoT Service-platform) project aims to develop an open source, intelligent IoT(Internet of Things) service platform based on international standards.

The Oasis project will be provided as open source as the outcome of the â€œ(ICBMS-3 specifics) The IoT Platform for Virtual Things, Distributed Autonomous Intelligence and Data Federation/Analysis"  as a newly supported by IT & broadcasting technology development project (2015).

The Oasis project will continue to grow as an open source based on the open source community.

# SO (Service Orchestration) Framework

The SO module is a standardized service orchestration framework that can adapt to dynamically created and changing IoT environments (services, sensors, devices, networks). 

## Main Functions

- Support for dynamically changing service, service driven environments and events in IOT environments.
- Standard-based architecture with service descriptions, service objectives, service details, and business specifications.
- Utilizing MultI-services as one independent service.
- Providing components and processes to select, configure and collaborate with the appropriate services to achieve the given goal.
